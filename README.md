Ported the amazing akka-tracing framework for using with Play 2.4

Still in the cleanup phase.




Akka Tracing [![Maven Central](https://img.shields.io/maven-central/v/com.github.levkhomich/akka-tracing-core_2.11.svg?style=flat-square)](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.github.levkhomich%22%20akka-tracing)
============

A distributed tracing Akka extension based on Twitter's [Zipkin](http://twitter.github.io/zipkin/).

It allows you to:
- trace call hierarchies inside an actor system;
- trace distributed calls (akka-remote, akka-cluster, finagle services, etc.);
- debug request processing pipelines (you can log to trace, annotate it with custom key-value pairs).
- find slow requests in your system;

Extension is designed to run on production systems (reactive, minimal overhead, adjustable sample rate) and
provides integration with Play framework and Spray.

See [wiki](https://github.com/levkhomich/akka-tracing/wiki) for more information.
